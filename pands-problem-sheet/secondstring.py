# Author: Amanda Murray

# This program asks the user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order

sentence = ("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
print (sentence [::-1]) # This will reverse the order of the sentence
reverseSentence = ("god yzal eht revo spmuj xof nworb kciuq ehT")
print (reverseSentence [1::2]) 
# This function addresses that the first letter in the sentence will equal to 0 by printing number 1 and every second letter afterwards
