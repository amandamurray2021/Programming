# Weekly Task 6
# This program takes a positive floating point number as an input
# It outputs an approximation of its square root
# It is necessary to create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this
# Author: Amanda Murray

print (input ("Please enter a positive floating point number: ")

def sqrt():

# I was unable to find a method of completing this program without using the in-built modules
# Although I did research Newton's method I was unable to translate it from a mathematical equation to code
# in order to approximate the square root of the floating point number
