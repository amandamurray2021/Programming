# Weekly Task 6
# This program takes a positive floating point number as an input
# It outputs an approximation of its square root
# It is necessary to create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this
# Author: Amanda Murray

print (input("Please enter a positive number: "))

def sqrt():

# Mathematical equation to code:
# x[n+1] = x[n] = f(x[n])/dfdx(x[n]) # from Ling & Lantangen's book (in Works Cited)
# x = x - f(x)/dfdx(x) 

# My understanding of what this code should do (based on the Newton-Raphson method) is that a problem is entered and using 
# the function and arguments it performs a number of iterations on the linear tangent on the x-axis to find the most accurate 
# solution to the problem. I was unable to find a method of completing this program without using the in-built modules
