# Project 2021
For this project, I have been asked to research Fisher's Iris data set and write documentation and code in Python to investigate it.


    ("In the Iris dataset we have 5 individual variables: petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and class
    "\nHere is a summary of the findings once they were plotted in histogram or scatterplot formats:
    "\n
    "\nPetal length
    "\nPetal length was plotted as a histogram, comparing the petal length in centimetres to the amount of irises. The histogram shows us
    "\nthat the Iris-setosa's petals are uniformly between 1-2 centimetres, while the Iris-versicolor's petals range between 3-5cm. The
    "\nIris-virginica's petals are between 5-7cm. There is an overlap between the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-virginica's petal length,
    "\nwhile the petals on the Iris-setosa are much shorter.
    "\n
    "\nPetal width
    "\nPetal length was plotted as a histogram, comparing the petal width in centimetres to the amount of irises. The histogram shows us
    "\nthat the Iris-setosa's petals are between 0.2 and 0.6mm, while the Iris-versicolor's petals range between 1 - 1.7cm. The Iris-
    "\nvirginica's petals range between 1.4 and 2.5cm. Again, we see an overlap between the Iris-versicolor and the Iris-virginica's petal
    "\nwidth, while the petals on the Iris-setosa are much narrower."
    "\n
    "\nSepal length
    "\nSepal length was plotted as a histogram, comparing the sepal length in centimetres to the amount of irises. The histogram shows us
    "\nthat the Iris-setosa's sepals are between 4.25 to 5.75cm. The Iris-versicolor's sepals are between 4.9 to 7cm, while the Iris-
    "\nvirginica's sepals are between 4.9 to 7.9cm. This is the first instance where we begin to see an overlap in sizing between all of
    "\nthe Iris species in the Iris dataset.
    "\n
    "\nSepal width
    "\nSepal width was plotted as a histogram, comparing the sepal width in centimetres to the amount of irises. The histogram shows us
    "\nthat the Iris-setosa's sepals are between 3.2 to 4.4cm in width. The Iris-versicolor's sepals are between 2 to 3.4cm in width, while
    "\nthe Iris-virginica's sepals are between 2.4 - 3.8cm in width. Again, we can see a considerable overlap between the Iris-versicolor and
    "\nthe Iris-virginica while the Iris-setosa's sepals tend to be wider than the other species.
    "\n
    "\nClass
    "\nThere are 150 irises in the Iris dataset, 50 of Iris-setosa, 50 of Iris-versicolor and 50 of Iris-virginica. This is why the histogram
    "\ndoes not show any variations.)
