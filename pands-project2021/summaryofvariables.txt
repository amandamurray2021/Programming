In the Iris dataset we have 5 individual variables:
1. Petal length in centimetres
2. Petal width in centimetres
3. Sepal length in centimetres
4. Sepal width in centimetres
5. Class (the species of iris flowers from the Iris dataset)

Here is a summary of each of the variables we will be reviewing in this project.

Petal length:
This is a list of 150 floats measuring the length of petals in centimetres in the following iris species:
Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.

Petal width:
This is a list of 150 floats measuring the width of petals in centimetres in the following iris species:
Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.

Sepal length:
This is a list of 150 floats measuring the length of sepals in centimetres in the following iris species:
Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.

Sepal width:
This is a list of 150 floats measuring the width of sepals in centimetres in the following iris species:
Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.

Class:
This is a list of 150 names of the Iris species in the dataset: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica.
There are 50 of Iris-setosa, 50 of Iris-versicolor and 50 of Iris-virginica.

Using Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn:
* We are going to plot each of these variables in histograms against their class.
* We are going to plot pairs of variables in scatterplots against their class.
